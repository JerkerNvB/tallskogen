This is a simple proof-of-concept Pinewood Derby timer for Arduino. 

## the good

 * Red / Yellow / Green traffic light
 * Beep when starting race
 * Servo for releasing start gate
 * Phototransistor for timer
 
## the bad

* Only one lane

## the ugly

* There are probably better ways of doing this.
